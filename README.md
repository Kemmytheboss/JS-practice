## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output will be the corresponding grade:

- A: 80-100
- B: 60-79
- C: 49-59
- D: 40-48
- E: 0-39

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print "License suspended".

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Write a program that calculates an individualâ€™s net salary by considering basic salary and benefits, including deductions for taxes, NHIF, and NSSF.

## Extra Practice Questions:

BubbleSort)
1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input. It should output an array of those same numbers sorted from lowest to highest.

sample input = [5,6,1,3,4,2]
Expected output = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

2. Staircase problem 
Create a function that takes an integer and console logs a step shaped stair with the integer levels using the # character 

e.g steps(2)  #
              ##

    steps(3)  #
